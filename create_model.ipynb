      "  low LLR p-value (1.222e-30).\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Key Risk Drivers:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Account Balance**: Highly significant (p < 0.001) with a positive coefficient of \n",
      "   0.5627, suggesting a strong relationship where higher account balances are associated \n",
      "   with an increased probability of the target event occurring.\n",
      "2. **Duration of Credit (month)**: Negative coefficient (-0.0223) with significance \n",
      "   (p = 0.020), indicating longer credit durations may marginally decrease the likelihood\n",
      "   of the target event.\n",
      "3. **Payment Status of Previous Credit & Value Savings/Stocks**: Both present positive \n",
      "   associations (coefficients of 0.2869 and 0.2100, respectively) with the target variable, \n",

      "   employment length seems to positively influence the target outcome.\n",
      "5. **Instalment Percent**: Significant (p < 0.001) negative impact (-0.3518) on the \n",
      "   probability of the target event, indicating higher instalment rates might lower \n",
      "   the chances.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Variables with Marginal or No Effect:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Purpose, Duration in Current Address, Age**, and others exhibit high p-values, \n",
      "  suggesting a limited or non-significant effect on the target.\n",

      "\n",
      "The model has meaningful predictors in financial history variables, whereas demographic and\n",

      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Simplification**: Consider removing variables that lack statistical significance, \n",

      "- **Multicollinearity**: Check for collinearity which may obscure the significance of \n",
      "  some predictors.\n",
      "- **Interaction Effects**: Explore if certain variables in combination influence the target.\n",
      "- **Validation**: Use a hold-out set to ensure the model's predictive ability generalizes \n",
