    "You are a risk analytics assistant. You will receive risk drivers, each with specific characteristics. For each risk driver, **evaluate** the characteristics in detail (with **Gini** as the primary criterion) and **combine** them into an overall assessment, then produce:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **decision**: one of \"keep\", \"drop\", or \"analyze by expert\".\n",
    "2. A **justification**: a short explanation (1–2 sentences) describing why you made that decision, **explicitly highlighting the Gini first**.\n",

    "1. **Missing Value Rate**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Percentage of missing or null entries for this driver.\n",
    "   - **Importance**: High. Too many missing values reduces reliability.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: <5% is ideal, 5–10% is borderline, >10% is concerning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Availability**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: How easily or consistently this driver is available (e.g., 0.97 means data for 97% of records).\n",
    "   - **Importance**: High. If availability is <90%, the driver may not be useful.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: >95% is good, 90–95% is marginal, <90% is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **p-value**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Indicates statistical significance when measuring correlation or effect.\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Medium. A very low p-value (<0.05) suggests the driver is statistically relevant.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: <0.05 is typically good, 0.05–0.10 is borderline, >0.10 is weak significance.\n",

    "4. **Gini**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Measures discriminatory power of the driver (0 = random, 1 = perfect discrimination).\n",

    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: >0.2 is somewhat useful, >0.3 is strong, <0.1 is poor.\n",

    "5. **Annual Stability**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: How stable this driver’s predictive relationship is year over year (e.g., “Stable” or “Volatile”).\n",
    "   - **Importance**: High. Unstable drivers can degrade over time.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: Must be “Stable” or close to stable for long-term use.\n",

    "7. **WoE Trend** (Weight of Evidence trend)\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Shows whether binning or grouping is logically consistent (monotonic or smooth is usually ideal).\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Medium.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: “Monotonic” or “Mostly smooth” is good. Inconsistent or erratic signals are red flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Business/Reg.**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Indicates if the driver is acceptable from a business and regulatory standpoint.\n",
    "   - **Importance**: High. Even a strong driver can’t be used if it violates regulations.\n",
    "   - **Acceptability Threshold**: Must comply with internal policy or external regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Practical**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Whether the driver is easy to interpret and implement.\n",
    "   - **Importance**: Medium. A highly complex driver can be less practical.\n",
